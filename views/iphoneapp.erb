      <!-- STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM -->

          <div class="col-sm-6 padding-lr-30">
            <h4>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</h4>
            <p>James enjoys cooking and he wish he was a better cook but he hasn’t  too much time to invest in it. He likes to go to the market, to make up recipes and to look for recipes online but he usually cooks the same 5 basic recipes. When he cooks, he has the habit to modify recipes on the fly without keeping track of changes. This makes really hard to reproduce the same recipes after a while.</p> 
          </div>
          </div>

          <!-- SOLUTION -->
        <div class="row blockPadding-50-top">
          <div class="col-sm-6 padding-lr-30">
            <h4>SOLUTION</h4>
            <p>In the quick couple of days we had to research, test and draft prototypes - I resulted with an app that is premised on making James a better cook, helping him to remember successful alterations to recipes, building his own recipes collection and giving him inspiration, in order to be able to reproduce successfully the recipes he likes and to add more variety to his repertoire.</p>

             <h4>NEEDFINDING</h4>
             <p>The first step of the porject was about focusing on the problems. Needfining included: get ready for the interview, conducting the interview, recording and taking notes, go throught all the materials all over again.</p>

             <h4>KEY FINDINGS</h4>
             <p>James <strong>enjoys cooking</strong>, he used to cook every da, sometimes even complex recipes, before he got married 9 months ago. Now <strong>he cooks 2/3 times a month</strong> because his wife is an amazing cook, she cooks very traditional Chinese food following her mum’s recipes. During the weekend sometimes they cook together and everyone makes his own dish.</br>
            <strong>James tends to prepare basic meals, usually the same 5/6 recipes. Sometimes he looks for recipes online</strong> and he makes his choice based on the picture and on the ingredients. </br>
            He used <strong>to alter recipes to follow his taste</strong> and his wife taste (she doesn’t like spicy food) but he doesn’t keep track of the alterations. The consequence is that <strong>he gets frustrated because recipes don’t taste the same every time.</strong>

            <h4>BRAINSTORMING</h4>
            <p>Brainstorming helps me to <strong>clean my brain</strong> from all ideas I had interviewing James writing them on paper. So I can forget about them while analyzing James needs and <strong>take them out later in the process where they are not anymore a threat but a resource.</strong></p>

            <h4>USER FLOW</h4>
            <p>Sketching the user flows helps me to define the main flow like <strong>the whole process,the decision points and the interaction with external resources.</strong></p>

            <h4>SCENARIOS</h4>
            <p> I have sketched some scenarios and I have validated them with James. Every scenario leaded me to very interesting features driven by the user need.</p>
          </div>
        </div> 

        <!-- SCENARIO 1 -->
        <div class="row blockPadding-50-top">

          <div class="col-sm-2 padding-lr-30">
            <h4>FIRST SCENARIO</h4>
            <p><strong>Very frequent</strong></p>
            <p>James goes to the market, then he makes up a recipe. He usually takes a picture if the dish looks good. After he eats if the recipes was good he may be willing to insert it in the app</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4 padding-lr-30">
            <img class="img"src="images/iphoneapp/scenario1_cook.jpg">
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-2 padding-lr-30">
            <h4>KEY FINDING</h4>
            <p>Cooking can be messy, this is why it would be nice if all the information could <strong>fit in one page, so there is no need to scroll.</strong> Also the <strong>iPhone shouldn’t turn the screen light off while in the recipe page.</strong></p>
          </div>
        </div>


        <!-- SCENARIO 2 -->
        <div class="row blockPadding-50-top">

            <img class="img"src="images/iphoneapp/scenario2.jpg">
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-2 padding-lr-30">
            <h4>SECOND SCENARIO</h4>
            <p><strong>Frequent</strong></p>
            <p>James wants to cook a recipe he made a few months ago. He doesn’t remember the ingredients and he looks them up on the app. He decides to slightly modify the recipe that actually tastes better this way.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4 padding-lr-30">
            <img class="img"src="images/iphoneapp/scenario2_clone.jpg">
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-2 padding-lr-30">
            <h4>KEY FINDING</h4>
            <p>James likes to alter recipes. Because usually the changes are small  it would be good to have a <strong>clone/duplicate  button.</strong> So he doesn’t have to fill the new recipe form from scratch and he saves time.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row blockPadding-50-top">

            <h4>SECOND SCENARIO</h4>
            <p><strong>Less frequent</strong></p>
            <p>James likes to find <strong>new recipes online using his desktop </strong>because he feels more comfortable with a bigger screen. When doing so he needs a tool that from his desktop sync with his phone sending  links, notes and pictures.</p>

          <div class="col-sm-4 padding-lr-30">
            <img class="img"src="images/iphoneapp/">
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-2 padding-lr-30">
            <h4>KEY FINDING</h4>
            <p>Here a very rough sketch of how the desktop interface could be. The basic features are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Send a link</li>
                <li>Send notes</li>
                <li>Select a picture from that url</li>
              </ul>

          <div class="col-sm-12 padding-lr-30">
            <h4>SKETCHES</h4>
            <p>These are some rough sketches I have done in order to understand the flow, how pages were connected and the main screens. I validated the sketches with James in order to iterate my design and understand design pain points.</p>

            <h4>ITERATED SKETCHES</h4>
            <p>Thanks to James validation I was able to iterate my design and improve some pages.</p>
            <p class="smaller">Key findings:
            <ul>
              <li>the sync with the desktop is now on the home page</li>
              <li>the recipe page has the main content fitting on the page: title, image, rates and lables on the top and the latest note on the bottom</li>
              <li>the image on the recipe page can be enlarged if clicked</li>
              <li>the recipe page edit now follows the design pattern of the recipe page</li>

            <h4>POP PROTOTYPE</h4>
            <p>I have realized a mock-up of the visual design in order to understand if the home page was meeting the business style.</p>

            <h4>RESULTS</h4>
            <p>The main result was to understand the process of validation of scenarios, sketches and protype.</p>
            <p>Validating scenarios helped me to understand which features to build and the app behaviour. The main keyfindinds are:
              <ul>
                <li>Clone button on detail recipe page</li>
                <li>Stop switching light screen off while in the recipe page</li>
                <li>Fit the most important info in the screen (without scrolling) in recipe page</li>
                <li>Provide a way to share links from the desktop to the app.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>  
            <p>The usability testing on the prototype helped me to fix layout problems and interactions: The main keyfindinds are:
              <ul>
                <li>Refine the home page</li>
                <li>Modify sync page</li>
                <li>Add back buttons to navigation</li>
                <li>Refine the recipe page</li>
