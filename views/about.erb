        <h1>Me &amp; UX</h1>
        <p>When I was young I wanted to be an Art Conservator, I took a Master degree in Fine Art and Science and I specialized in contemporary art. After Uni I won a grant and I flew to New York to work as Art conservator and I really loved to be sourranded ny art and beauty but I wanted a more creative job. </p>

        <p>I self-tough me to be a designer and I got a job as designer in a software house start-up. I worked both in the Marketing than in the R&amp;D, I made videos, marketing campaigns, collaterals, websites, interface designer and visual designer. </p>

        <p>People liked the interface but they had trouble using the product so I started studying UX on my own and bring it to my company. I really wanted to boost my competence in UX and this is why I ended up at GA. </p>
