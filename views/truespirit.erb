      <h4>Brief</h4>
      <p>TrueSpirit is a new internet retailer for schools and parents who want a modern school uniform for K-12 children. Unlike traditional suppliers, TrueSpirit encourages visitors to express their tastes with some limits.</p>
      <h4>Challenge</h4>
      <p>TrueSprit wants to create an appropriate experience for their target customer that could be delivered via iPad as the primary delivery channel.</p>

        <h4>My Role</h4>
        <p>Realize sketches for all pages, realize wireframes in Omnigraffle, realize an early-prototype in InVision, realize a mockup for the home page, improve and update user flows and sitemaps, execute design iterations, provide innovative ways to communicate our design.</p>

        <h4>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS  &amp; RESEARCH</h4>
        <p>The competitor analysis involved both school uniforms e-commerce and fashion e-commerce. This research helped us to understand what the competitors are doing and what they are not doing in order to define a strategy.</p>
        <p><strong>School uniform e-commerce analyzed:</strong> Your Uniform Shop, School Uniform Australia, Made for School, Yeroga Uniforms.</br><strong>Fashion e-commerce analyzed:</strong>  Uniqlo, Polyvore, Net a porter, Yoox, Asos.</p>

    <!--CARD SORTING & SITE MAP-->

      <div class="col-sm-8 padding-lr-30">
        <h4>CARD SORTING &amp; SITE MAP</h4>
        <p>Card sorting was used to define categories for TrueSpirit navigation. The main problems were:
        <ul>
          <li>Define the main criteria for organizing categories (tops and bottoms, boys and girls, summer and winter uniforms).</li>
          <li>Define subcategories.</li>
          <li>Identify in which subcategory to divide items.</li>
          <li>Define clear labels for categories, subcategories and items.</li>
        <p>After we defined the categories, we organized the rest of content in the Site Map.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-sm-8 padding-lr-30">
        <h4>SKETCHES &amp; SCENARIOS</h4>
        <p>I have started to create sketches of the product page and of the category page. The goal was to condense in one design the best ideas collected during the competitor analysis. In order to reach the best solution possible, the team sketched every page individually and reviewed them as a team. I have also created some scenarios including low fidelity sketches to test the navigation system and to understand which features to include in the e-commerce.</p>

        <h4>MAIN  PAGES</h4>
        <p>The wireframes were realized with Omnigraffle. On the left side of every wireframe there are some annotations, these include the description of the main features and the explanations for the design choices.  </p>
        <p>They represent, from left to right, the home page, the category view and the product page. </p>

        <h4>USABILITY TESTING</h4>
        <p>The prototype has been tested on 3 people thorough a Gorilla Testing.</p>
        <p><strong>Pain points:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>We expected picture to zoom but user expected it to be a link to go to the details page dropdown menu and filter (colors, prices).</li>
          <li>One user would have saved his profile if it didn't include saving his credit card details.</li>
          <li>User went to sales button to find a polo shirt rather than top navigation bar.</li>
          <li>2/3 users could not find the alternative views (e.g. gallery versus list).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>VISUAL DESIGN</h4>
        <p>Starting from the home page wireframe, I have realized the home page mock-up using Photoshop. The goal was to understand if the home page wireframe could be successfully converted in a mock-up. The visual design I have realized follows the business style requirements and uses the logo colors.</p>
        <p><strong>Business style requirements:</strong></br> Fresh, modern, light hearted, open, appealing,  friendly, curated, there when you need us but not in your way.</p>
        <p><strong>Colors:</strong></br> Light blue and dark gray.</p>

    <!-- PRESENTATION -->
    <div class="row blockPadding-50-top">
      <div class="col-sm-8 padding-lr-30">
        <h4>STORYTELLING</h4>
        <p>In order to communicate our design effectively, during the presentation, we have played a role game. Deepa was the external narrator and James was pretending to be John, one of our personas. This allowed us to show the full prototype explaining what the user does, sees and thinks while purchasing the school uniform items.</p>
        <p>After the role game I have explained our group's main design choices and the process we went through in order to make our design decisions.</p>

        <h4>RESULTS</h4>
        <p>In two weeks the team was able to design wireframes for all the main pages of the website: product page, category page, home page and also screens for the check-out process and a customizable site for the schools. The design was iterated based on the observations and findings from the usability testing.</p>
